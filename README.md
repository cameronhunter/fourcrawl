A pub crawl (or any kind of tour, really) based on Foursquare. Sign up for the crawl at a web page, then get a notification of the first location. Check in there, and get a notification for the next place...

Working on it at the SF hackathon. Need more devs to help out!

Here's the demo 4sq list we're using for the crawl: https://foursquare.com/mappingmashups/list/demo-list-for-fourcrawl-hack
